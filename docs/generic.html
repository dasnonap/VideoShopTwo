								<h2>How the app works</h2>
								<p>The application is divided into five different layers. Each layer can only communicate with the layer below him. </p>
								<div class="div row">
									<div class="div column">
										<img src="images/arch 2.png" />
									</div>
									<div class="div column">									
										<h2>First Layer</h2>
										<p>
											The bottom layer is the database, which is implemented through MSSQL.In there I store all the information about films, series, subscriptions, genres, employees, cities, and for users.
											Where the information about the user is hashed and then saved in to the database.
										</p>			
													
										<h2>Second Layer</h2>
										<p>
											Then there is the TableTemplate class that communicates with the database. 
											It is template because for each query to a table it goes through this class. Who, according to the class that is submitted, knows in which table to look for the data.
										</p>	

										<h2>Third Layer</h2>
										<p>
											Then there are the so-called buffer classes, which are used to store data from the tables in the database. 
											They help us to speed up, because when we search for something it is searched in an array and not immediately in the database, which significantly slows down the operation
										</p>	

										<h2>Forth Layer</h2>
										<p>
											Then the ViewControl class, which houses most of the business logic. I use it to load certain data into the ListViewControls for tables. 
											Also in this class I use the Singleton design pattern, in order to always work with one instance of the buffer classes. 
											In it I load the specified data according to what type of login has occured user or administrator type of login.
										</p>

										<h2>Fifth Layer</h2>
										<p>	
											This layer is where all of the information is presented to the user and where he can interact with the data.
											In these forms there are a lot of radio buttons and context menus to make the user's work easier. Also here I include the class for hashing user data.
